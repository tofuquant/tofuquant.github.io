For whatever reason last winter, I decided to send in an application for [Jane Street's](https://www.janestreet.com/) Quantitative Trading internship. I always had them in sight, went for their campus market making games, heck I even have a deck of cards from them.  Well, I can honestly say I did not expect a call back.

Little did I know, my resume stood out to them, and next up was their renowned interview process; brainteasers, probability and statistics questions, and market making. An eye-opener to me, who always had the 'fit' type of questions from past employers. Doing questions on paper is one thing, it really is a whole different ball game over the phone with only your brain.

The people from the Hong Kong office were no doubt amazing, but sadly I did not get that offer. Maybe with more oral preparations doing brainteasers and probability questions could have helped, but maybe that is for another time. What I really took away was being more confident in my skills, and the humility to continually develop them.

Side note, if anyone is up to learn and play the game of [Figgie](https://www.janestreet.com/figgie/), do hit me up!
